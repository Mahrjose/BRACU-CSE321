I was not there to see your sunrise
when the first rays of light
pierced the darkness
and ruddy fire burst upon the horizon
I was not there

I was not there to see your morning
your dewy green
filled with wonder and exploration
light and life
I was not there

I was not there to see your noonday
when heat was at its prime
and shadows disappeared
beneath your feet
I was not there

But I was there to see your evening
the lengthening shadows on the ground
gray clouds and thunder
and the rain
I was there

And I will stay to watch your sunset
when ruddy fire bursts once again
upon the horizon…
and when it fades and yields to darkness
I’ll be there still
